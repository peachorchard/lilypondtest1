Georgia On My Mind

This was my first real introduction to LilyPond.  It is not very efficient but it looks fine.

It uses some of the more common notations so you can take a look at the pdf, find the notation in the code and use it in your music files.

## Suggested Changes
I was writing this .ly file 3-4 bars at a time.  Ideally you would break it into voices and combine them on the staves, use variables more, and add guitar fingerings.
